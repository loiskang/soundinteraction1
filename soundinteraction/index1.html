<div id="text1">
	I wanted the users to interact and play with the sounds I recorded through a digital medium. I explored different types of sound and broke them into 4 groups on the keyboard. Mechanical sounds are grouped in uiopjklm, object sounds are grouped in tyghbn, water sounds are grouped in erdfcv, and other sounds are grouped in qwaszx keys.</div>
